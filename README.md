# Sqlalchemy Challenge

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

> Utilized [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) to analyze climate database

> Analysis completed utilizing  [SQLAlchemy ORM queries](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/query.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)


## Precipitation Analysis

> Retrieved last 12 months of precipitation data using a query

> Created Pandas DataFrame of the precipitation data

> Plotted the results


## Station Analysis

> Designed queries to calculate the total number of stations and the most active stations

> Created a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data of the most active station

> Plotted the results as a histogram


## Step 2 - Climate App

> Designed a Flask API based on the queries from Step 1

> Utilized Flask to create the routes

> Routes created:
 - Home page
 
 - precipitation
 
 - stations
 
 - tobs (temperature observations)
 
 - start date
 
 - start date and end date
